# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

#### ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE

#### REGULATORY AUTHORITY FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

## Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

### OPINION

The financial statements of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (the Authority), set out on pages 1 to 30, have
been audited under my direction. These financial statements comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 March 2023,
and the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the financial year
then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the accompanying financial statements are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Public
Sector (Governance) Act 2018 (the PSG Act), the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act 2004 (the ACRA Act) and
Statutory Board Financial Reporting Standards so as to present fairly, in all material respects, the state of affairs of the Authority
as at 31 March 2023 and the results, changes in equity and cash flows of the Authority for the financial year ended on that date.

### BASIS FOR OPINION

The audit was conducted in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs). The responsibilities under those standards
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of this report. As the
Auditor-General, I am independent of the Authority and I exercise my duties and powers in accordance with the Constitution
of the Republic of Singapore and the Audit Act 1966 (the Audit Act). Ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit and in
line with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants
and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) have been fulfilled. I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for my opinion.

### OTHER INFORMATION

The management is responsible for the other information. The other information obtained at the date of this auditor’s report is
the Statement by the Authority but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon.

My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

In connection with the audit of the financial statements, the auditor’s responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or the knowledge obtained
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, there is a material
misstatement of this other information, that fact will be reported. I have nothing to report in this regard.

### RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR

### THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the
provisions of the PSG Act, the ACRA Act and Statutory Board Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal controls
as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Authority is constituted based on the ACRA Act and its dissolution requires Parliament’s approval. In preparing the financial
statements, management is responsible for assessing the Authority’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing,
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is intention to
wind up the Authority or for the Authority to cease operations.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Authority’s financial reporting process.

misstatement of this other information, that fact will be reported. I have nothing to report in this regard.

### RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR

### THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the
provisions of the PSG Act, the ACRA Act and Statutory Board Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal controls
as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Authority is constituted based on the ACRA Act and its dissolution requires Parliament’s approval. In preparing the financial
statements, management is responsible for assessing the Authority’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing,
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is intention to
wind up the Authority or for the Authority to cease operations.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Authority’s financial reporting process.


### AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, professional judgement is exercised and professional scepticism is maintained
throughout the audit. An audit also includes:

- Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
    designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and
    appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
    higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
    or the override of internal controls.
- Obtaining an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
    appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s
    internal controls.
- Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
    disclosures made by management.
- Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
    audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
    doubt on the Authority’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I will
    draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are
    inadequate, modify my opinion. My conclusion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report.
    However, future events or conditions may cause the Authority to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether
    the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit are communicated to those charged with governance.

Auditor-General
Singapore

## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

### OPINION

In my opinion:

(a) the receipts, expenditure, investment of moneys and the acquisition and disposal of assets by the Authority during
the financial year are, in all material respects, in accordance with the provisions of the PSG Act, the ACRA Act and the
requirements of any other written law applicable to moneys of or managed by the Authority; and

(b) proper accounting and other records have been kept, including records of all assets of the Authority whether purchased,
donated or otherwise.

### BASIS FOR OPINION

The audit was conducted in accordance with SSAs. The responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Compliance Audit section of this report. As the Auditor-General, I am independent of the
Authority and I exercise my duties and powers in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and the
Audit Act. Ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit and in line with the ACRA Code have been fulfilled. I believe that the
audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion on management’s compliance.

### RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT FOR COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL AND

### REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

The management is responsible for ensuring that the receipts, expenditure, investment of moneys and the acquisition and
disposal of assets, are in accordance with the provisions of the PSG Act, the ACRA Act and the requirements of any other
written law applicable to moneys of or managed by the Authority. This responsibility includes monitoring related compliance
requirements relevant to the Authority, and implementing internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable
compliance with the requirements.

### AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE COMPLIANCE AUDIT

My responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s compliance based on the audit of the financial statements.
The compliance audit was planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the receipts, expenditure,
investment of moneys and the acquisition and disposal of assets, are in accordance with the provisions of the PSG Act,
the ACRA Act and the requirements of any other written law applicable to moneys of or managed by the Authority.

A compliance audit includes obtaining an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the receipts, expenditure, investment
of moneys and the acquisition and disposal of assets; and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements from non-compliance, if any, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s
internal controls. Because of the inherent limitations in any internal control system, non-compliances may nevertheless occur
and not be detected.

#### NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023


## 2. Significant Accounting Policies

### (A) BASIS OF PREPARATION

```
The financial statements of the Authority have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Public Sector
(Governance) Act 2018, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act 2004 and the Statutory Board Financial
Reporting Standards (“SB-FRS”).
```
```
The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars which is also the functional currency of the Authority.
All financial information presented in Singapore dollars have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise
stated. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
```
```
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SB-FRS requires management to exercise its judgement
in the process of applying the Authority’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of accounting estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income or expenditure during the financial year.
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may
ultimately differ from these estimates.
```
```
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
```
### New or revised accounting standards effective in 2022

```
The new or revised SB-FRS mandatory for application did not have any material impact on the Authority’s financial
statements.
```
### New or revised accounting standards not yet effective

```
The Authority has not early adopted the following standards which are applicable to the Authority but not yet effective:
```
#### EFFECTIVE DATE

#### (ANNUAL PERIODS

```
```
The Authority expects that the adoption of the above standards will have no material impact on the financial statements
in the year of initial application.
```

### (B) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

```
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Projected cost of dismantlement,
removal or restoration are included as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment if there is obligation for
dismantlement, removal or restoration as a consequence of acquiring or using the asset.
```
```
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Authority and the cost
of the asset can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised in expenditure when incurred.
```
```
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their depreciable
amounts over their estimated useful lives as follows:
```
```
Furniture and fittings 8 years
Office equipment 5 to 8 years
Computer hardware and system 3 to 5 years
Leased premises over lease period of 9 years
```
```
The depreciation method, estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each
financial year-end. The effects of any revision are recognised in expenditure when the changes arise.
```
```
On disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying
amount is recognised in income or expenditure.
```
### (C) INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND AMORTISATION

```
Intangible assets consist mainly of computer software and development costs for various computer application systems.
They are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to bring to use or develop the specific software. Direct expenditure
which enhance or extend the performance of computer software beyond its specifications and which can be reliably
measured is recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software. Costs associated with
maintaining computer software are recognised in expenditure when incurred.
```
```
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. These costs
are amortised to income or expenditure using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of 5 years.
The amortisation period and method are reviewed at each financial year-end. The effects of any revision are recognised
in income or expenditure when the changes arise.
```
```
On disposal of an item of intangible assets, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is
recognised in income or expenditure.
```
### (D) DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS-IN-PROGRESS

```
Development projects-in-progress relate to projects on computer systems and/or internally developed applications relating
to the operations of the Authority. No depreciation or amortisation is provided for development projects-in-progress until
they are transferred to property, plant and equipment or intangible assets.
```

### (E) IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

```
Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and development projects-in-progress are reviewed at each reporting
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable
amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost
to sell and its value in use. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash inflows
that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
```
```
An impairment loss is recognised in expenditure if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each reporting date for any indications
that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates
used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of any accumulated depreciation
or amortisation, if no impairment loss has been recognised. Reversal of impairment loss is recognised in income.
```
### (F) TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

```
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for impairment. They are included in current assets,
except those maturing later than 12 months after the financial year are classified as non-current assets. Trade and other
receivables are derecognised when they have been received or the rights to receive cash flows from the customers
have expired.
```
```
The Authority applies the simplified approach for trade receivables and recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime
expected credit losses at each reporting date. Lifetime expected credit losses are estimated based on the Authority’s
credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors and general economic conditions, taking
into consideration both the current and the forecast direction of conditions. The amount of the allowance is recognised
in expenditure.
```
```
When the asset becomes uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance accounts. Subsequent recoveries of amounts
previously written off are recognised in income.
```
```
The carrying amounts recorded at the end of the financial year approximate their fair values and are not expected to be
significantly different from the values that would eventually be received. ,
```
### (G) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

```
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, bank balances and deposits maintained with Accountant-General’s
Department that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes
in value.
```
### (H) TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES

```
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
```
```
The carrying amounts recorded at the end of the financial year approximate their fair values and are not expected to be
significantly different from the values that would eventually be settled.
```

### (I) PROVISIONS

```
Provisions are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Authority has a legal or constructive obligation
as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and
a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
```
```
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate, taking into
consideration the time value of money. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required
to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.
```
### (J) INCOME RECOGNITION

```
Revenue is recognised when the Authority satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service
to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be
satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied
performance obligation, generally measured based on the consideration to which the Authority expects to be entitled
in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer.
```
```
Company, variable capital company, business, public accountant and corporate service provider incorporation/registration
and renewal fees are recognised at a point in time when the registration or renewal is granted. Fees pertaining to regulatory
inspections of public accountants are recognised over time.
```
```
Information service fees from online sales are recognised at a point in time when information is provided. Fees from sales
through agreements are recognised over time.
```
```
Agency fee and income from other services provided are recognised over the period in which the services are rendered.
```
```
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
```
### (K) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

### (i) Defined contribution plans

```
Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Authority pays fixed contributions
into Central Provident Fund. The Authority has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been
paid. The Authority’s contributions are recognised as staff costs when they are due.
```
### (ii) Employees’ leave entitlements

```
Employees’ entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to the employees. A provision is made
for the estimated liability for annual leave earned by the employees as a result of services rendered up to the end of
the financial year.
```
### (iii) Pension benefits

```
Provision for pension is made for the payment of pension benefits to pensionable officers under the provisions of the
Pensions Act 1956. The cost of pension benefits due to pensionable officers is determined based on the discounted
present value of expected payouts to be made by the Authority in respect of services provided by these pensionable
officers up to the end of the financial year. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on government
bonds that have maturity dates approximating the tenure of the related pension obligation. Any actuarial gain or
loss arising from the valuation of pension provision is immediately recognised as other comprehensive income or
expense not reclassified subsequently to income or expenditure.
```

### (L) LE ASES

```
The Authority applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and
leases of low-value assets. The Authority recognises lease liabilities representing the obligations to make lease payments
and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying leased assets.
```
### Right-of-use assets

```
The Authority recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is
available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses,
and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease
liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any
lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term
and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
```
```
The Authority’s right-of-use assets are presented within property, plant and equipment (Note 5).
```
### Lease liabilities

```
At the commencement date of the lease, the Authority recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease
payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments.
```
```
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Authority uses the incremental borrowing rate which is the cost
of equity as defined under the cost of capital framework by the Ministry of Finance at the lease commencement date
because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount
of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition,
the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in
the lease payments (e.g. change to future payments resulting from a change in the rate used to determine such lease
payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying assets.
```
```
The Authority’s lease liabilities are disclosed in Note 11.
```
### Leases of low-value assets

```
The Authority applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of computer equipment and office
equipment that are considered to be low value and payments made under such operating leases are taken to income or
expenditure on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
```
### (M) GOVERNMENT GRANTS

```
Government grants are recognised at their fair values where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received
and all conditions attached will be complied with. When the grants relate to compensation for expenses incurred, they are
recognised in the income or expenditure on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised.
Where the grants relate to assets, the grants are recognised as deferred capital grants in the Statement of Financial
Position. The deferred capital grants are amortised and credited to the income or expenditure over the periods necessary
to match the depreciation charged of the assets or when the assets are disposed or written off.
```

## 3. Critical Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements

```
Estimates, assumptions and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The critical
accounting estimates and assumptions are stated below:
```
### ESTIMATED IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

```
Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and development projects-in-progress are tested for impairment
whenever there is any objective evidence or indication that these assets may be impaired.
```
### Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables

```
The Authority uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables. The provision
rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns.
```
```
The provision matrix is initially based on the Authority’s historical observed default rates. At every reporting date,
historical default rates are updated.
```
```
The Authority’s historical credit loss experience may also not be representative of its debtor’s actual default in the future.
The information about the ECLs on the Authority’s trade receivables is disclosed in Note 9.
```
### Determination of lease term of contracts with extension options

```
The Authority determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any period covered by
an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised.
```
```
Where the lease contract for office premises provides an extension option, the Authority applies judgement in evaluating
whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to extend the lease. That is, it considers all relevant
factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the extension. After the commencement date, the Authority
reassesses the lease term whether there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control
and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to extend. The Authority will include the extension option
in the lease term for leases of office premises because of the significant costs that would arise to replace the assets.
```
## 4. Share Capital

```
The 8,601,000 (2021/2022: 8,601,000) shares are fully paid and held by the Minister for Finance, a body incorporated

## 28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

### (A) CREDIT RISK

```
The Authority’s exposure to credit risk arises mainly from customers and financial institutions. Credit risk exposure
is minimised by placing deposits with Accountant-General’s Department under Whole-of-Government Centralised
Liquidity Management and Statutory Board Approved Funds Scheme as well as high credit quality financial institutions.
The maximum exposure at the end of the financial year, in relation to each class of recognised financial asset, is the
carrying amount of those assets as indicated in the Statement of Financial Position.
```
### (B) LIQUIDITY RISK

```
The Authority monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by management to
finance the Authority’s operations. The Authority does not have a significant exposure to liquidity risk at the end of the
financial year.
```
### (C) INTEREST RATE RISK

```
The exposure to risk for changes in interest rate relates primarily to deposits placed with Accountant-General’s
Department under Whole-of-Government Centralised Liquidity Management and high credit quality financial institutions.
```
### (D) CURRENCY RISK

```
The Authority is not subject to any significant foreign exchange exposure.
```
### (E) CAPITAL RISK

```
The Authority manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while fulfilling its
objective as a statutory board. The capital structure of the Authority consists of share capital and accumulated surplus.
There were no changes in the capital management approach during the financial year and the Authority is also not
subject to externally imposed capital requirements, except for those mandated by the Ministry of Finance.
```

## 29. Subsequent Events

```
With the passing of the Accountancy Functions (Consolidation) Act 2022, the Authority (ACRA), the Singapore
Accountancy Commission (SAC) and the Accounting Standards Council (ASC) merged under one entity with effect
from 1 April 2023. The merged entity took on the name of the Authority.
```
```
All the business and undertakings and all rights and obligations of the SAC and ASC were transferred and vested in
the Authority on 1 April 2023. The assets and liabilities will be transferred at their net book value, with a corresponding
amount credited to the Authority’s other reserve account.
```
## 30. Comparative Figures

30.1 Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

30.2 With effect from 1 September 2021, monies can no longer be placed by the secretarial, law and accounting firms with
the Authority for transactions. As such monies placed have to be refunded to the firms, the deposits have been reclassified
to Trade and Other Payables to better represent the nature of the payables.

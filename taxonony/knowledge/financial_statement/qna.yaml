  - context: |
        The financial statements of the Authority have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Public Sector
(Governance) Act 2018, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act 2004 and the Statutory Board Financial
Reporting Standards (“SB-FRS”). The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars which is also the functional currency of the Authority.
All financial information presented in Singapore dollars have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise
stated. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SB-FRS requires management to exercise its judgement
in the process of applying the Authority’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of accounting estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income or expenditure during the financial year.
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may
ultimately differ from these estimates.Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.

INCOME RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised when the Authority satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service
to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be
satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied
performance obligation, generally measured based on the consideration to which the Authority expects to be entitled
in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer.
Company, variable capital company, business, public accountant and corporate service provider incorporation/registration
and renewal fees are recognised at a point in time when the registration or renewal is granted. Fees pertaining to regulatory
inspections of public accountants are recognised over time.
Information service fees from online sales are recognised at a point in time when information is provided. Fees from sales
through agreements are recognised over time.
Agency fee and income from other services provided are recognised over the period in which the services are rendered.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

  - context: |
The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) accounts for property, plant and equipment (PPE) at cost,
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost includes all expenditures directly attributable to the
acquisition of the assets, including projected dismantlement or restoration costs if the Authority has such obligations.
Subsequent expenditures are capitalised only when they provide probable future economic benefits and can be reliably measured;
otherwise, they are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is applied on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives, 
with categories such as furniture, office equipment, IT systems, and leased premises having specific assigned periods. 
Estimates related to useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, and any revisions are recognised in expenditure.
Gains or losses from asset disposals are reported in income or expenditure based on the difference between proceeds and carrying value.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
         How does ACRA determine the initial cost of property, plant, and equipment (PPE), and what additional costs may be included?
        answer: |
         ACRA records property, plant, and equipment at cost, which includes all expenditures directly attributable to acquiring the asset. 
         This also encompasses projected costs for dismantlement, removal, or restoration if such obligations arise as a consequence of acquiring 
         or using the asset. These additional costs are capitalised and form part of the total cost of the asset, in accordance with applicable accounting policies.
      - question: |
         Under what conditions does ACRA capitalise subsequent costs related to PPE, and how are other maintenance expenses treated?
        answer: |
         Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to ACRA 
         and when the costs can be measured reliably. These costs are either added to the carrying amount of the existing asset or recognised as a separate asset. 
         In contrast, routine repairs and maintenance that do not meet these criteria are expensed immediately when incurred.
      - question: |
         What depreciation method does ACRA use for its PPE, and how are useful lives determined for different asset types?
        answer: |
         ACRA uses the straight-line depreciation method to allocate the cost of PPE over their estimated useful lives. 
         Asset categories such as furniture and fittings are depreciated over 8 years, office equipment over 5 to 8 years, 
         computer hardware and systems over 3 to 5 years, and leased premises over the lease period of 9 years. 
         The depreciation method, useful life, and residual values are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary, with 
         changes recognised in expenditure when they arise.
  - context: |
  The table presents a breakdown of the Authority’s property, plant and equipment (PPE) across categories such as 
  leased premises, furniture and fittings, office equipment, and computer hardware and systems. It covers the periods 
  from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023. The PPE costs are tracked along with additions, disposals, and accumulated 
  depreciation. For instance, in FY2021, the Authority recognised right-of-use assets worth S$24.021 million for leased premises, 
  while disposals in the same year reduced total asset costs by over S$13 million. Depreciation is applied annually, 
  such as S$3.593 million for leased premises in FY2021 and S$2.688 million in FY2022. As of 31 March 2023, the net 
  book value of all PPE amounted to S$27.538 million, down from S$29.454 million the previous year. 
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
        What major changes occurred in the value of leased premises between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2023?
        answer: |
        The most significant change was the recognition of right-of-use assets worth S$24.021 million for leased premises 
        in FY2021, following the disposal of previously held assets valued at S$5.484 million. By 31 March 2023, the net 
        book value for leased premises decreased to S$19.262 million from S$21.895 million in the previous year, reflecting 
        continued depreciation and only minimal additions.
      - question: |
        How did the Authority account for computer hardware and systems between FY2022 and FY2023?
        answer: |
        In FY2022, the Authority added S$1.426 million worth of computer hardware and systems while disposing of S$4.310 million, 
        resulting in a cost balance of S$13.489 million by 31 March 2022. In FY2023, an additional S$2.879 million was purchased, 
        bringing the total to S$16.368 million. Depreciation for the financial year was S$1.990 million, leading to a net book 
        value of S$7.389 million as of 31 March 2023.
      - question: |
        What was the overall impact of depreciation and asset disposals on the Authority’s PPE from FY2021 to FY2023?
        answer: |
        The Authority experienced total depreciation charges of S$5.390 million in FY2021 and S$4.850 million in FY2022. 
        In FY2021, disposals reduced asset costs and accumulated depreciation by S$13.359 million. These activities gradually 
        decreased the overall net book value of PPE from S$29.454 million in 2022 to S$27.538 million in 2023, showing 
        a downward adjustment driven by both wear-and-tear (depreciation) and asset retirement.
  - context: |
The Authority’s intangible assets primarily consist of internally-developed applications used to support its operations. 
These assets are amortised over periods ranging from 1 to 5 years. As of 31 March 2023, the total cost of intangible assets 
amounted to S$46.726 million, reflecting a transfer of S$2.949 million from development projects and a minor purchase of S$8,000. 
There were no disposals during the year. The accumulated amortisation stood at S$33.746 million, which included 
S$4.349 million charged for the financial year. The resulting net book value of intangible assets at the end of the 
financial year was S$12.980 million, down from S$14.372 million in the prior year. In comparison, the previous year 
included a disposal of S$924,000 and a smaller transfer amount from development-in-progress.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
        How did the Authority's intangible assets change between 2021/2022 and 2022/2023?
        answer: |
        The net book value of intangible assets decreased from S$14.372 million in 2021/2022 to S$12.980 million in 2022/2023. 
        This was due to amortisation of S$4.349 million, despite a transfer of S$2.949 million from development-in-progress 
        and a minor purchase. Unlike the prior year, no disposals were recorded in 2022/2023.
      - question: |
        What is the typical amortisation period for the Authority’s intangible assets, and what type of assets are they?
        answer: |
        The intangible assets primarily consist of internally-developed applications that support the Authority’s operations. 
        These are amortised over a period ranging from 1 to 5 years, depending on their useful life. The same amortisation 
        range applied in both 2021/2022 and 2022/2023.
      - question: |
        How did disposals affect intangible assets in 2021/2022 compared to 2022/2023?
        answer: |
        In 2021/2022, the Authority disposed of intangible assets valued at S$924,000, which reduced both the cost and 
        accumulated amortisation figures. In contrast, there were no disposals recorded in 2022/2023, meaning the changes 
        in asset value were solely due to additions and amortisation.

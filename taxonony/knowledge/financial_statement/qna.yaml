  - context: |
        The financial statements of the Authority have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Public Sector
(Governance) Act 2018, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act 2004 and the Statutory Board Financial
Reporting Standards (“SB-FRS”). The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars which is also the functional currency of the Authority.
All financial information presented in Singapore dollars have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise
stated. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SB-FRS requires management to exercise its judgement
in the process of applying the Authority’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of accounting estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income or expenditure during the financial year.
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may
ultimately differ from these estimates.Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
